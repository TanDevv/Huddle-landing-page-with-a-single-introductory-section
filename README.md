## Overview

### The Challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page

## My Process

It felt very good to come back and start a new project. I unforunately had a hectic past 2 months of falling ill and at the same time moving house! Thankfully I am in better health and have now settled in my new place! :)

While I took a break, I also finally started learning SASS, I have found it quite interesting if not a bit confusing at first, I chose not to use this project with SASS but I intend on implementing it with my next project.

But on to the project!

I will start with the style-guide.md file. Then I will try to gauge what fonts were used in which areas awhile making my --custom properties.

I struggled with the desktop version on this project frankly, I ended up restarting over again only once as I just felt I could do it a lot better than how it turned out, plus taking some time off sick really put me in a rut whilist I was learning. Thankfully I am happy on how this turned out!

I tried something new and instead went desktop first then mobile, it was interesting trying to make everything smaller, I think I prefer a mobile first approach but I can see how sometimes trying desktop first if you are struggling can actually help you figure things out better!

Other than that, I didn't run into many issues as I was making this project.

I did learn about FontAwesome and I like how easy it is to find svg icons! I noticed a few people either use the FA Kits or just use the CDN library, is there much difference in which you use or pros/cons with both?
